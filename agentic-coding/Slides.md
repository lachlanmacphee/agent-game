> There's no shortage of over-hyped AI products, but there are under-hyped technological and social implications that will make AI one of the largest drivers of change since the industrial revolution.

\- paraphrased from my coworker Sam McLeod

## Heads Up

I'm by no means an expert on this topic. I encourage you to point out any mistakes if you see them. I will **graciously** accept your wisdom or keen eye-for-detail.

## Definitions

---
### Generative AI

 Generating content in the form of text/audio/images/video from a given prompt.

---
### Large Language Model (LLM)

A prediction engine trained on **massive** text datasets to understand and generate text.

> **Think of a model (LLM) like a chef who's cooked thousands of recipes.** They remember how to cook not by storing exact dishes - but understanding how ingredients typically work together to create new combinations.

\- Sam McLeod

---
### Agentic AI / Agents

*LLM*s with a *persona* and a set of *tools* that can make *decisions* to complete a *goal*.

---
### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Provides a consistent method for models to connect to data sources and tools.

---
## A History Lesson

---

- 2022: ChatGPT and equivalents become mainstream
- 2023-2024: Coding Assistants and AI Peer Review
- 2025: The Year of Agents

This means if you are still using **exclusively** ChatGPT for software development, you are already around **3 years behind**. At the rate things are currently changing, that's a **very long** time.

*Disclaimer: these dates are rough estimates*

---
## The Modern Approach

> Create a live chat application with sockets in C. Consider features like disconnections on either client or server, and handling of multiple clients.

---
### Advantages

With agentic technologies, you can get:
- Autonomous AI software development with human direction
- High quality code with high quality prompts
- Effective utilisation of tools such as the terminal and web browsers

If *and only if* you know how to use them properly.

---
### Limitations

- Cannot yet do complex software redevelopment without engineering skills or architectural mindset.
- Inability to work at a business level - i.e. there will be stakeholders who wont trust it for years to come, and still require legacy processes.

---
This means, software engineering jobs are *somewhat* safe for now, but at the pace things are changing who knows what it will look like in 10, 5, even 3 years time, especially for junior positions.

## Build An Agent

---
### Agent 01

![[Pasted image 20250515155701.png]]

---

- LLM: Middle-aged dad
- Persona: Wannabe-tradie with a mission to DIY
- Tools: Basic toolkit, impact driver, a drill, and a grinder
- Decisions: Mostly ego, occasionally uses YouTube
- Goal: Build a fence

---
### Agent 02

### My Projects

---
#### RunClub

In 2023, I built an open source running club time tracker and management tool. It took me months to build from end-to-end, with almost zero use of AI.

---
#### tursim

Last year, I built a Turing machine simulator for FIT2014. It took me a week or two to build a simple, frontend-only web app from end-to-end with some use of ChatGPT.

---
#### The Better Handbook

This year, I built a fully-functional, independent, and open-source Monash unit reviewing platform **over a weekend** with agentic AI and a fullstack web framework. It has authentication, a clean UI, and a ton of functionality.

---
#### The Point

> You can ship software faster than ever before.
---

## Current Offerings

These are the most popular extensions or IDEs for adding agentic AI to your workflow.

---
- **Cline**: Open-source VS Code Extension with support for MCP tooling, a fully agentic coding experience, and support for any AI model provider.
- **Roo Code**: Fork of Cline with more configuration / settings you can tweak.
- **Windsurf** / **Codium**: Closed-source forks of VS Code. Traditional Copilot + agentic experience. Paywalls for some features.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Open-source (as of yesterday) traditional copilot with a basic agentic experience. Some MCP tooling support. Copilot Pro is free with a Github Education license.

## Concluding Remarks

If you could please leave a review of at least 1 unit on The Better Handbook, you would be doing me and present/future students a massive favour!
